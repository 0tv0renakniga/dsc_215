### mod10_precheck

1.  What does ANOVA stand for?
    * ☑ Analysis of Variance
    * ☐ Analysis of Verification
    * ☐ Analysis of Variability
    * ☐ Analysis of Variation

2.  What is the primary test statistic used in ANOVA?
    * ☑ F-statistic
    * ☐ T-statistic
    * ☐ Chi-square statistic
    * ☐ z-score

3.  Which condition ensures that data points do not influence each other?
    * ☐ Variability
    * ☐ Normality
    * ☐ Randomness
    * ☑ Independence

4.  Mean Square Error (MSE) in ANOVA measures:
    * ☐ Variance between groups
    * ☐ Total variance in the data
    * ☑ Variance within groups
    * ☐ The mean difference between groups

5.  Degrees of freedom in ANOVA are related to:
    * ☐ The number of groups compared
    * ☑ Both the number of groups and the sample size
    * ☐ The sample size in each group
    * ☐ The total number of observations

6.  A higher degrees of freedom in ANOVA typically leads to:
    * ☑ A less skewed F-distribution
    * ☐ No change in the F-distribution
    * ☐ A more skewed F-distribution
    * ☐ A narrower F-distribution

7.  After a significant ANOVA, multiple comparisons are used to:
    * ☐ Calculate a new F-statistic
    * ☐ Confirm the significance of the ANOVA test
    * ☐ Increase the overall significance level
    * ☑ Identify which specific groups differ in means

### mod10_review

1.  What is a key difference between ANOVA and pairwise comparisons?
    * ☑ ANOVA can compare more than two group means simultaneously
    * ☐ It specifies the number of categories in the data
    * ☐ Pairwise comparisons use the F-statistic
    * ☐ ANOVA compares only two means at a time

2.  What does the null hypothesis in ANOVA state?
    * ☑ All group means are equal
    * ☐ All group means are different
    * ☐ No group means are equal
    * ☐ At least one group mean is different

3.  What does the normality condition imply in ANOVA?
    * ☐ The overall data set should be normal
    * ☐ The means of all groups should be normal
    * ☑ Data within each group should be nearly normal
    * ☐ All groups have the same number of observations

4.  The F-statistic in ANOVA is calculated based on:
    * ☐ The sum of squared differences within each group
    * ☑ The ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance
    * ☐ The ratio of within-group variance to between-group variance
    * ☐ The difference between the largest and smallest group means

5.  The Bonferroni correction in ANOVA is used to:
    * ☐ Recalculate the F-statistic
    * ☐ Adjust the degrees of freedom
    * ☑ Decrease the risk of Type I errors
    * ☐ Increase the power of the test

6.  Failing to reject the null hypothesis in ANOVA indicates:
    * ☑ No significant difference between the group means
    * ☐ At least one group mean is different from the others
    * ☐ The test was inconclusive
    * ☐ There is a significant difference between group means
