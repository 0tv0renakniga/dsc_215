    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Statistics?\n",
    "- **Definition**: A discipline that focuses on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data\n",
    "- **Applications**: Used in various fields including:\n",
    "  - \"Hard\" Sciences (physics, chemistry, biology)\n",
    "  - Social Sciences (politics, economics, education)\n",
    "  - Medicine\n",
    "  - Business and industry\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data\n",
    "- **Numerical Data**: Quantitative measurements\n",
    "  - **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., number of students in a class)\n",
    "  - **Continuous**: Measurements on a continuous scale (e.g., height, weight)\n",
    "- **Categorical Data**: Qualitative classifications\n",
    "  - **Nominal**: Categories with no natural ordering (e.g., dog breeds, political party)\n",
    "  - **Ordinal**: Categories with a natural ordering (e.g., education level, satisfaction ratings)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Matrix Structure\n",
    "- **Observations/Cases**: Individual entities being measured (rows in a data matrix)\n",
    "- **Variables**: Characteristics being measured for each observation (columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Dog Breed Study\n",
    "```\n",
    "| Dog ID | Breed     | Weight (kg) | Height (cm) | Fur Length (cm) |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| 1      | Husky     | 25          | 58          | 5               |\n",
    "| 2      | Bulldog   | 22          | 40          | 2               |\n",
    "| 3      | Chihuahua | 2.5         | 20          | 3               |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- Each row represents one dog (an observation/case)\n",
    "- The variables are Breed (categorical), Weight (numerical-continuous), Height (numerical-continuous), and Fur Length (numerical-continuous)\n",
    "- There are 3 categorical levels for the Breed variable: Husky, Bulldog, and Chihuahua\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Relationships Between Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Associations\n",
    "- **Positive Association**: Variables increase or decrease together\n",
    "  - Example: House size and price tend to increase together\n",
    "- **Negative Association**: One variable increases as the other decreases\n",
    "  - Example: Homeownership rate decreases as percentage of multi-unit structures increases\n",
    "- **No Association**: No discernible pattern between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Roles\n",
    "- **Explanatory Variable**: Variable that might affect or explain changes in another variable\n",
    "  - Also called independent variable or predictor\n",
    "- **Response Variable**: Variable that may be affected by the explanatory variable\n",
    "  - Also called dependent variable or outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: Association does not imply causation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing Relationships\n",
    "- **Scatterplots**: Used to visualize relationships between two numerical variables\n",
    "  - Each point represents a single observation\n",
    "  - Pattern of points indicates type and strength of relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Homeownership and Multi-Unit Structures\n",
    "```\n",
    "The scatterplot shows a negative association between homeownership rate and \n",
    "percentage of multi-unit structures in counties. As the percentage of multi-unit \n",
    "structures increases, the homeownership rate tends to decrease.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Collection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observational Studies\n",
    "- **Definition**: Data collected without interference in how variables arise\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - Good for identifying natural associations\n",
    "  - Cannot establish causation\n",
    "  - Subject to confounding variables\n",
    "- **Applications**: Surveys, existing records, cohort studies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiments\n",
    "- **Definition**: Designed investigations where researchers control variables\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "  - Can establish causal connections\n",
    "  - Involves treatment and control groups\n",
    "  - Uses randomization to control for confounding variables\n",
    "- **Key Components**:\n",
    "  - **Treatment Group**: Receives the intervention being studied\n",
    "  - **Control Group**: Provides a baseline for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Sampling Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Population vs. Sample\n",
    "- **Population**: The entire set of cases about which we want to draw conclusions\n",
    "- **Sample**: A subset of the population from which we collect data\n",
    "- **Sampling Frame**: List of cases from which the sample is drawn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Methods\n",
    "- **Simple Random Sampling**: Each case has an equal probability of selection\n",
    "  - Formula for probability of selection: $P(\\text{selection}) = \\frac{n}{N}$\n",
    "  - Where n = sample size, N = population size\n",
    "- **Stratified Sampling**: Population divided into groups, then random sampling within groups\n",
    "- **Cluster Sampling**: Population divided into clusters, then entire clusters selected\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Bias\n",
    "- **Non-response Bias**: When certain types of subjects are less likely to respond\n",
    "  - Example: Only 30% of people respond to a survey, potentially skewing results\n",
    "- **Convenience Sampling**: Using easily accessible subjects (often leads to bias)\n",
    "  - Example: Surveying only people walking in a particular neighborhood\n",
    "- **Voluntary Response Bias**: When sample consists of self-selected volunteers\n",
    "  - Example: Online product reviews typically come from very satisfied or very dissatisfied customers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Experimental Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principles\n",
    "- **Control**: Managing differences between treatment and control groups\n",
    "- **Randomization**: Random assignment to account for uncontrollable variables\n",
    "- **Replication**: Using more cases for better estimation\n",
    "- **Blocking**: Subdividing based on variables that may affect response\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing Bias in Human Experiments\n",
    "- **Blind Studies**: Participants unaware of their treatment status\n",
    "- **Double-Blind Studies**: Both participants and researchers unaware of treatment status\n",
    "- **Placebos**: Fake treatments given to control groups\n",
    "  - Helps account for the placebo effect (improvement due to expectation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Experimental Design\n",
    "```\n",
    "Study: Effect of a sleeping pill on people with trouble sleeping\n",
    "\n",
    "Design elements:\n",
    "- 80 participants with trouble sleeping\n",
    "- Blocking variable: Age (40 people >50 years old, 40 people <50 years old)\n",
    "- Random assignment within blocks to treatment or control\n",
    "- Treatment: One sleeping pill per week\n",
    "- Control: Placebo pill\n",
    "- Blinding: Participants don't know which pill they received (single-blind)\n",
    "- Duration: 10 weeks\n",
    "- Response variable: Quality of sleep\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Drawing Valid Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation vs. Causation\n",
    "- Association between variables does not imply causation\n",
    "- Causation can only be established through well-designed experiments\n",
    "- Observational studies can suggest but not prove causal relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalizability\n",
    "- Results from a sample can only be generalized to the population it represents\n",
    "- Random sampling improves generalizability\n",
    "- External validity refers to how well results apply to other situations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Valid and Invalid Conclusions\n",
    "```\n",
    "Study: Survey of 50 students in a statistics class about voluntary work participation\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid conclusion: \"X% of students in this specific statistics class participate in \n",
    "voluntary work.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Invalid conclusion: \"Studying statistics causes students to participate in voluntary \n",
    "work.\" (Correlation doesn't imply causation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Invalid conclusion: \"X% of all university students participate in voluntary work.\" \n",
    "(Cannot generalize beyond the specific class)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Key Formulas and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Random Sampling\n",
    "- Each case has equal probability of selection: $P(\\text{selection}) = \\frac{n}{N}$\n",
    "- Where n = sample size, N = population size\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomization in Experiments\n",
    "- Random assignment helps ensure treatment and control groups are comparable\n",
    "- Helps control for confounding variables\n",
    "- Can be done using random number generators, coin flips, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Common Misconceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation implies causation**: Just because two variables are associated doesn't mean one causes the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Larger samples are always better**: While larger samples generally provide more precision, a large biased sample is worse than a small unbiased sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical significance equals practical importance**: A statistically significant result may not be practically meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Anecdotal evidence is reliable**: Individual stories or experiences are not statistically valid evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **All studies are equally valid**: The design and methodology of a study greatly affect the validity of its conclusions.\n"

    "  - Median increases by the constant: $\\text{median}_{new} = \\text{median} + c$\n",
    "  - Range and standard deviation remain unchanged\n",
    "  - Example: Converting Celsius to Fahrenheit (F = C + 32)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiplying by a constant (c × x)**:\n",
    "  - Changes both center and spread\n",
    "  - Mean is multiplied by the constant: $\\bar{x}_{new} = c \\times \\bar{x}$\n",
    "  - Median is multiplied by the constant: $\\text{median}_{new} = c \\times \\text{median}$\n",
    "  - Range and standard deviation are multiplied by |c|\n",

    "## 9. Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Analyzing Loan Interest Rates\n",
    "A dataset contains interest rates for 50 loans with the following statistics:\n",

    "- Q₁: 7.5%\n",
    "- Q₃: 15%\n",
    "- IQR: 7.5%\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram shows a right-skewed distribution, indicating that most loans have rates under 15%, with a few loans having rates above 20%. Since the distribution is skewed, the median (9.93%) is a better measure of central tendency than the mean (11.57%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Comparing Student Quiz Scores\n",
    "A class of students took a quiz, and the 5-number summaries are given for 18 freshmen and 15 sophomores:\n",

    "- If the sample variance $s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \\bar{X})^2$ is used instead of $\\sigma^2$, then $\\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}}$ follows a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom\n",
    "- Has heavier tails than the normal distribution\n",
    "- Approaches the standard normal distribution as degrees of freedom increase\n",

    "### F-Distribution\n",
    "- Ratio of two chi-squared distributions, each divided by their degrees of freedom:\n",
    "  $$F = \\frac{U/d_1}{V/d_2}$$\n",

    "If $W = \\frac{\\chi^2_3/3}{\\chi^2_2/2}$, then W follows an F-distribution with degrees of freedom 3 and 2, denoted as $F_{3,2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Practical Applications in Statistical Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "- Test statistics often follow specific distributions under the null hypothesis\n",
    "- The distribution of the test statistic is used to calculate p-values\n",
    "- Example: For testing if a coin is fair after 100 flips with 60 heads:\n",
    "  - Test statistic: $Z = \\frac{60-50}{5} = 2$\n",
    "  - Under the null hypothesis (p = 0.5), Z follows approximately $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$\n",

    "## 9. Key Properties of Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete vs. Continuous Random Variables\n",
    "- **Discrete Random Variables**:\n",
    "  - Take values from a countable set\n",
    "  - Have a probability mass function (PMF)\n",
    "  - Example: Number of points scored in a basketball game\n",
    "  - For discrete RVs, $\\mathbb{P}(X = x)$ can be positive\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Random Variables**:\n",
    "  - Take values from an uncountable set (typically an interval)\n",
    "  - Have a probability density function (PDF)\n",
    "  - Example: Distance walked in a day\n",
    "  - For continuous RVs, $\\mathbb{P}(X = x) = 0$ for any specific value x\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Symmetric Distributions\n",
    "- If Z has a symmetric distribution around 0 and $\\mathbb{P}(Z < a) = 0.25$, then:\n",
    "  - $\\mathbb{P}(Z > -a) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(Z \\leq -a) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(Z < -a) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$\n",
    "  - This is because for symmetric distributions, $\\mathbb{P}(Z < -a) = \\mathbb{P}(Z > a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Different distributions model different types of random phenomena\n",
    "2. The normal distribution is central to statistical inference due to the Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "3. Z-scores standardize observations for comparison across different distributions\n",
    "4. The binomial distribution can be approximated by the normal distribution under certain conditions\n",
    "5. The t-distribution, chi-squared distribution, and F-distribution are crucial for statistical inference when population parameters are unknown\n",

    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**:\n",
    "  - Makes a specific claim about the parameter (often that there is \"no effect\" or \"no difference\")\n",

    "### Power of a Test\n",
    "- **Definition**: The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (1 - β)\n",
    "- **Factors affecting power**:\n",
    "  - Sample size (larger samples increase power)\n",
    "  - Effect size (larger differences from H₀ are easier to detect)\n",
    "  - Significance level (higher α increases power but also increases Type I error risk)\n",

    "   - Using p-values: Reject H₀ if the p-value is less than the significance level α\n",

    "4. Type I error occurs when we reject a true H₀; Type II error occurs when we fail to reject a false H₀\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The significance level α represents the probability of making a Type I error\n",
    "\n",
    "6. When conducting a hypothesis test for a proportion:\n",

    "- Equivalently: power = 1 - P(Type II error)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors Affecting Power\n",
    "1. **Sample size**: Larger samples increase power\n",
    "2. **Effect size**: Larger differences are easier to detect\n",
    "3. **Variability**: Less variability increases power\n",

    "### Calculating Power\n",
    "1. Determine the rejection region under H₀\n",

    "## Module 10 Summary: Comparing Many Means with ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is ANOVA?\n",
    "- **Definition**: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to compare means across multiple groups\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Tests whether there are significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups\n",
    "- **Advantage over Multiple t-tests**: \n",
    "  - Reduces the risk of Type I errors that would accumulate when conducting multiple pairwise comparisons\n",
    "  - If you have k groups, you would need k(k-1)/2 pairwise comparisons, increasing the chance of finding differences by random chance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Framework\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: All population means are equal\n",
    "  $$H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\ldots = \\mu_k$$\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: At least one population mean is different from the others\n",
    "  $$H_1: \\mu_i \\neq \\mu_j \\text{ for some } i \\neq j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Conditions for Valid ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Key Conditions\n",
    "1. **Independence**: \n",
    "   - Observations are independent within each group\n",
    "   - Observations are independent across groups\n",
    "   - Typically satisfied by random sampling or random assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normality**: \n",
    "   - The data within each group is approximately normally distributed\n",
    "   - Less critical for larger sample sizes due to the Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "   - Can be assessed using histograms, Q-Q plots, or formal tests\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variability** (Homogeneity of Variance): \n",
    "   - The variability across groups is approximately equal\n",
    "   - Can be assessed by comparing standard deviations or using formal tests like Levene's test\n",
    "   - ANOVA is somewhat robust to violations of this assumption when sample sizes are equal\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The F-Statistic and F-Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Idea\n",
    "- ANOVA compares two sources of variation:\n",
    "  - **Between-group variation**: Variation of group means around the overall mean\n",
    "  - **Within-group variation**: Variation of individual observations around their group means\n",
    "- If the between-group variation is large relative to the within-group variation, we have evidence that the group means differ\n",
    "\n",
    "### The F-Statistic\n",
    "- **Formula**:\n",
    "  $$F = \\frac{\\text{Mean Square Between Groups (MSG)}}{\\text{Mean Square Error (MSE)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Square Between Groups (MSG)**:\n",
    "  $$\\text{MSG} = \\frac{1}{k-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i(\\bar{x}_i - \\bar{x})^2$$\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - k = number of groups\n",
    "  - n_i = sample size of group i\n",
    "  - $\\bar{x}_i$ = sample mean of group i\n",
    "  - $\\bar{x}$ = overall sample mean\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Square Error (MSE)**:\n",
    "  $$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n-k} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i(\\bar{x}_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\right)$$\n",
    "  where n = total sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "### The F-Distribution\n",
    "- The F-distribution is parametrized by two degrees of freedom:\n",
    "  - **df₁** = k - 1 (degrees of freedom for MSG)\n",
    "  - **df₂** = n - k (degrees of freedom for MSE)\n",
    "- Properties:\n",
    "  - Always non-negative (ratio of variances)\n",
    "  - Right-skewed, especially with low degrees of freedom\n",
    "  - Becomes less skewed as degrees of freedom increase\n",
    "  - Under H₀, the F-statistic follows an F-distribution with df₁ and df₂ degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Conducting an ANOVA Test\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Procedure\n",
    "1. **Prepare**: Identify the groups and collect data\n",
    "2. **Check**: Verify the conditions for ANOVA\n",
    "3. **Calculate**: Compute the F-statistic\n",
    "4. **Conclude**: Determine the p-value and make a decision\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Course Delivery Methods\n",
    "A professor taught the same class in three different formats (remote, hybrid, and in-person) and wants to know if the mean final scores differ. Here are the scores:\n",

    "- F = $\\frac{MSG}{MSE} = \\frac{49.85}{40.30} = 1.24$\n",

    "- df₂ = 15 - 3 = 12\n",

    "- Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the mean final scores differ across the three teaching formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Multiple Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Multiple Comparisons Problem\n",
    "- If ANOVA rejects H₀, we know that at least one mean differs, but we don't know which ones\n",
    "- To identify specific differences, we need to conduct pairwise comparisons\n",
    "- However, conducting multiple tests increases the risk of Type I errors (false positives)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonferroni Correction\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Controls the overall Type I error rate when conducting multiple comparisons\n",
    "- **Adjusted Significance Level**:\n",
    "  $$\\alpha^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{K}$$\n",
    "  where K = k(k-1)/2 is the number of pairwise comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Justification**: By the union bound in probability theory:\n",
    "  $$\\mathbb{P}\\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{K} (p_i \\leq \\alpha/K) \\right) \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\mathbb{P}(p_i \\leq \\alpha/K) \\leq \\alpha$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Pairwise Comparisons with Bonferroni Correction\n",
    "Suppose ANOVA indicates significant differences among four groups (A, B, C, D) with α = 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: Calculate the number of pairwise comparisons\n",
    "- K = 4(4-1)/2 = 6 comparisons (A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: Calculate the adjusted significance level\n",
    "- α* = 0.05/6 = 0.0083\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Conduct pairwise t-tests\n",
    "- For each pair, calculate the t-statistic and p-value\n",
    "- Compare each p-value to α* = 0.0083\n",
    "- Only pairs with p-values < 0.0083 are considered significantly different\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note\n",
    "- It is possible to reject the null hypothesis in ANOVA but not find significant differences in any pairwise comparisons\n",
    "- This does not invalidate the ANOVA result\n",
    "- It simply means we cannot identify which specific groups differ with the given sample sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Practical Example: Travel Routes\n",
